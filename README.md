# Electron + Vue.js Computer Resource Desktop Application
Built using the [Electron Typescript React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP-371MN0Ck) from freeCodeCamp.org

Replaced entire front end with the front end integration with Vue.js because I wanted a small challenge and I personally like.

Styled it to look somewhat Cyberpunk-ish
